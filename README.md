# C++ Socket Chat Server Practice

## What this project for

A simple project for study Modern C++, Makefile and socket communication

## The list I'm going to do that I hope

- Modern C++ (C++17)

Many key features from the modern languages are getting be implemented into C++ over time so that we can consider Modern C++ a concentrated language of full of features.

- Clang

Which is not that different from gcc in various aspects but supports cross-platform.

- Makefile

Getting be familiar with Makefile by writing them from scratch. Then, I hope I will learn and convert to CMake if I have more time.

- TDD (Test Driven Developement)

I have a little bit of knowledge about TDD on Python but haven't on the other languages.
